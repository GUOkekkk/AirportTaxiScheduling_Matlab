# AirportTaxiScheduling_Matlab
This project focuses on the scheduling of airport taxis, taking into account average taxi efficiency, taxi waiting times in the storage pool, weather issues, workshop distances and vehicle pick-up methods, as well as the data collected, to propose a selection strategy for airport taxi drivers, the location of 'pick-up points' for airport management and an arrangement to equalise the earnings of short-haul taxi drivers.The problem is solved by Excel and Matlab(mainly). But the paper is in chinese version, if need more information feel free to contact me.
